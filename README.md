# Lancer Sheet Only CSS Tweaks

Some tweaks to the CSS of the Lancer system to make it display better on mobile when using the Sheet Only module.  Designed for in-person play.

Tweaks:

* Everything on the mech loadout tab displays in a single column, to avoid too much text squishing.
* The mech stats page is pushed down to two columns.
* The attack HUD is made to show targets in two columns, and made scrollable if there are too many to fit on the page.

All of those will apply for any player with Sheet Only activated.

Other improvements will come over time - this is mainly for my personal use right now - for that reason, it's not getting improvements to the NPC mech sheets for a while (since I run the GM side on a laptop), unless requested.
